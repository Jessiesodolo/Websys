# Websys Lab 4


Part 1:

To get this part to work I simply created a string var that was equal to an unordered list, with list elements for each corresponding piece of information. For example at the end of the .each function a var named "art" would store an unordered list, with list elements of the artist name from the JSON file that would get appended to the id "artist" in the html file.
  
Part 2:

The intial structure of the html document was different from what I had in lab 2. I used the prepend() and append() functions
to add and move elements around in a similiar structure. Once my structure was corrected I simply adjusted the css to match
the class names and id names used to format the data to resemble my lab 2. I wasn't aware I could have just used my orginal HTML
file from lab 2, so a lot of the manipulations done before the ajax call were to structure the html file given.
