# Websys Lab 4


Part 1:

  To get this part to work I simply created string unordered list elements and just list elements for each piece of information.
  For example at the end of the .each function a var named "art" would store an unordered list, list elements of the artist name 
  that would get appended to the id "artist" in the html file.
  
Part 2:

The intial structure of the html document was different from what I had in lab 2, so I used the prepend() and append() functions
to add and move elements around in a similiar structure. Once my structure was corrected I simply adjusted the css to match
the class names and id names used to format the data to resemble my lab 2.
